# Program by: Shervin Marco Mangulabnan
# Date of Creation: September 26, 2024
# Purpose: this program calculates Voltage, Current, or Resistance using Ohm's Law.

# Display the available calculation choices to the user
# Ask the user for their choice
# Calculate Voltage (V = I * R)
# Calculate Current (I = V / R)
# Calculate Resistance (R = V / I)
# Handle any input that isn't a valid number
# End of the program
